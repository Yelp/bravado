Configuration
=============

Client Configuration
--------------------
You can configure certain behaviours when creating a ``SwaggerClient``.

bravado and bravado-core use the same config dict. The full documentation for
`bravado-core config keys <http://bravado-core.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html>`_
is available too.

.. code-block:: python

    from bravado.client import SwaggerClient, SwaggerFormat

    my_super_duper_format = SwaggerFormat(...)

    config = {
        # === bravado config ===

        # What class to use for response metadata
        'response_metadata_class': 'bravado.response.BravadoResponseMetadata',

        # Do not use fallback results even if they're provided
        'disable_fallback_results': False,

        # DEPRECATED: Determines what is returned by HttpFuture.result().
        # Please use HttpFuture.response() for accessing the http response.
        'also_return_response': False,

        # === bravado-core config ====

        # Validate incoming responses
        'validate_responses': True,

        # Validate outgoing requests
        'validate_requests': True,

        # Validate the swagger spec
        'validate_swagger_spec': True,

        # Use models (Python classes) instead of dicts for #/definitions/{models}
        'use_models': True,

        # List of user-defined formats
        'formats': [my_super_duper_format],

    }

    client = SwaggerClient.from_url(..., config=config)

Config key                 Type            Description
-------------------------- --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
*response_metadata_class*  string          | The Metadata class to use; see
                                           | :ref:`custom_response_metadata` for details.

                                           Default: :class:`bravado.response.BravadoResponseMetadata`
*disable_fallback_results* boolean         | Whether to disable returning fallback results, even if
                                           | they're provided as an argument to
                                           | to :meth:`.HttpFuture.response`.

                                           Default: ``False``
*also_return_response*     boolean         | Determines what is returned by the service call.
                                           | Specifically, the return value of :meth:`.HttpFuture.result`.
                                           | When ``False``, the swagger result is returned.
                                           | When ``True``, the tuple ``(swagger result, http response)``
                                           | is returned. Has no effect on the return value of
                                           | :meth:`.HttpFuture.response`.
                                           | See :ref:`getting_access_to_the_http_response`.

                                           Default: ``False``
*sensitive_headers*        list            | Determines which headers are to be considered sensitive and
                                           | filtered from debug logging.

                                           Default: ``['Authorization']``
========================== =============== ===============================================================

Customizing the HTTP client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

bravado's default HTTP client uses the excellent `requests library <http://www.python-requests.org/>`_ to make HTTP
calls. If you'd like to customize its behavior, create a :class:`bravado.requests_client.RequestsClient` instance
yourself and pass it as ``http_client`` argument to :meth:`.SwaggerClient.from_url` or :meth:`.SwaggerClient.from_spec`.

Currently, you can customize SSL/TLS behavior through the arguments ``ssl_verify`` and ``ssl_cert``. They're identical
to the ``verify`` and ``cert`` options of the requests library; please check
`their documentation <http://www.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>`_ for usage
instructions. Note that bravado honors the ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` environment variable as well.

Also you can specify custom future adapter and response adapter classes through the ``future_adapter_class`` and
``response_adapter_class`` arguments respectively.

Using a different HTTP client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use other HTTP clients with bravado; the fido client ships with bravado (:class:`bravado.fido_client.FidoClient`).
Currently the fido client doesn't support customizing SSL/TLS behavior.
But the future adapter and response adapter classes could be specified in the same manner as for
:class:`bravado.requests_client.RequestsClient` - through the ``future_adapter_class`` and
``response_adapter_class`` arguments respectively.

Another well-supported option is `bravado_asyncio <https://github.com/sjaensch/bravado-asyncio>`_, which requires
Python 3.5+. It supports the same ssl options as the default requests client.

.. _request_configuration:

Per-request Configuration
--------------------------
Configuration can also be applied on a per-request basis by passing in
``_request_options`` to the service call.

.. code-block:: python

    client = SwaggerClient.from_url(...)
    request_options = { ... }
    client.pet.getPetById(petId=42, _request_options=request_options).response().result

------------------------- --------- -------  -----------------------------------------------
*connect_timeout*         float     N/A      | TCP connect timeout in seconds. This is
                                             | passed along to the http_client when
                                             | making a service call.
*headers*                 dict      N/A      | Dict of http headers to to send with
                                             | the outgoing request.
*response_callbacks*      list of   []       | List of callables that are invoked after
                          callables          | the incoming response has been validated
                                             | and unmarshalled but before being
                                             | returned to the calling client. This is
                                             | useful for client decorators that would
                                             | like to hook into the post-receive event.
                                             | The callables are executed in the order
                                             | they appear in the list.
                                             | Two parameters are passed to each callable:
                                             | - ``incoming_response`` of type
                                             |   ``bravado_core.response.IncomingResponse``

*timeout*                 float     N/A      | TCP idle timeout in seconds. This is passed
                                             | along to the http_client when making a
                                             | service call.
*use_msgpack*             boolean   False    | If a msgpack serialization is desired for
                                             | the response. This will add a Accept:
                                             | application/msgpack header to the request.
*force_fallback_result*   boolean   False    | Whether a potentially provided fallback
                                             | result should always be returned,
                                             | regardless of whether the request
                                             | succeeded.
                                             | Mainly useful for manual and automated
                                             | testing.
*follow_redirects*        boolean   False    | Whether redirects returned by the server
                                             | are followed, or returned as-is.
                                             | **Note:** Currently, the fido HTTP client
                                             | does not support following redirects, and
                                             | will ignore this option.
