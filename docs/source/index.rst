bravado documentation
========================

This project acts as a generic client library for services which follow *Swagger* schema.

More information on Swagger can be found `on the Swagger website
<https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/>`_

It aims to be a complete replacement to `swagger codegen <https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen>`__.

Features include:

* Synchronous and Asynchronous clients out of the box.
 
* Caching of api-docs with regular staleness check.

* Strict validations to check swagger spec is `v2.0 <https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md/>`_ compatible.

* Validations on the parameter and response types.

* Request and Response values are handled with Python types (no need to deal with JSON).

* Doc strings are provided for Operations and Models to give more information about the API.

* Local file path to api-docs is also acceptable.
