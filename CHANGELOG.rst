-------------------
- | Make following redirects configurable, and off by default, in the default requests-based HTTP client - Issue #449, PR #454, #457. Thanks Matthew Dowdell for your contribution!
  | Note that this bugfix is a behavior change of the default HTTP client, which used to always follow redirects.

10.3.2 (2019-03-25)
-------------------
- Do not warn about conflicting timeouts in requests HTTP client if only one was specified - PR #411. Thanks Pokey Rule for your contribution!
- Fix bug in :class:`bravado.fido_client.FidoResponseAdapter`, it was not returning a unicode string for ``text`` - PR #412

10.3.1 (2019-02-27)
-------------------
- Fix :attr:`.bravado.response.BravadoResponseMetadata.is_fallback_result`, it was always ``True`` in 10.3.0 - Issue #409, PR #410

- :mod:`bravado.testing.response_mocks` is now type-annotated - PR #410

10.3.0 (2019-02-20)
-------------------
- bravado is now fully type-annotated - PR #403
- Add ability to cancel a HttpFuture. Third-party HTTP clients will need to implement ``cancel`` on their :class:`.bravado.http_future.FutureAdapter` class to support this - PR #406
- The static method ``from_config_dict`` of :class:`.bravado.config.BravadoConfig` was removed due to compatibility issues with Python 3.5.0. This method was meant for internal use only; if you do happen to call it please switch to :func:`.bravado.config.bravado_config_from_config_dict` instead. - PR #407

-------------------
- Fix issue with default (requests) HTTP client if HTTP_PROXY environment variable is set - Issue #401, PR #402. Thanks Lourens Veen for the initial report!

-------------------
- Reraise network errors when unmarshalling - PR #397

10.1.0 (2018-06-26)
-------------------
- Add support for non-callable fallback results, stabilize the response API - PR #376
- Add unified connection error handling support, introduce :class:`.bravado.exception.BravadoConnectionError` - PR #377
- Support per-request API key header overwriting - PR #374. Thanks Yuliya Bagriy for your contribution!
- Extract integration testing tools to :mod:`bravado.testing.integration_test` module - PR #378

10.0.1 (2018-06-20)
-------------------
- Add helper classes (in :mod:`bravado.testing.response_mocks`) for unit testing code using bravado - PR #375

10.0.0 (2018-06-15)
-------------------
- Re-add ability to force returning fallback results - PR #372. Per-request configuration is now handled by the
  new :class:`bravado.config.RequestConfig` class. This change requires an updated version of bravado-asyncio
  in case you're using that HTTP client.

9.3.2 (2018-06-15)
------------------
- Revert ability to force returning fallback results which was introduced in 9.3.1, since it contains
  backwards-incompatible changes that break third-party HTTP clients like bravado-asyncio.

9.3.1 (2018-06-14)
------------------
- Add ability to force returning fallback results - PR #372

9.3.0 (2018-06-05)
------------------
- Introduce the HTTPFuture.response API as well as support for returning a fallback result. - PR #365, #366, #367, #368

  *NOTE:* Most of this API is not documented yet and is considered experimental; we're working on stabilizing it
  and providing developer documentation.

9.2.2 (2017-12-19)
------------------
- Fix msgpack import issue - PR #341. Thanks Jesse Myers for your contribution!

9.2.1 (2017-12-07)
------------------
- The timeout exception for the requests client should inherit from ``requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout`` instead of ``requests.exceptions.Timeout`` - PR #337

9.2.0 (2017-11-10)
------------------
- Support msgpack as wire format for response data - PR #323, 328, 330, 331
- Allow client to access resources for tags which are not valid Python identifier names, by adding the ``SwaggerClient.get_resource`` method.
  For example, ``client.get_resource('My Pets').list_pets()`` - PR #320. Thanks Craig Blaszczyk for your contribution!
- Unify timeout exception classes. You can now simply catch ``bravado.exception.BravadoTimeoutError`` (or ``builtins.TimeoutError`` if you're using Python 3.3+) - PR #321

9.1.1 (2017-10-10)
------------------
- Allow users to pass the tcp_nodelay request parameter to FidoClient requests - PR #319

9.1.0 (2017-08-02)
------------------
- Make sure HTTP header names and values are unicode strings when using the fido HTTP client.
  NOTE: this is a potentially backwards incompatible change if you're using the fido HTTP client and
  are working with response headers. It's also highly advised to not upgrade to bravado-core 4.8.0+
  if you're using fido unless you're also upgrading to a bravado version that contains this change.

9.0.7 (2017-07-05)
------------------
- Require fido version 4.2.1 so we stay compatible to code catching crochet.TimeoutError

9.0.6 (2017-06-28)
------------------
- Don't mangle headers with bytestring values on Python 3

9.0.5 (2017-06-23)
------------------
- Make sure headers passed in for fetching specs are converted to str as well

9.0.4 (2017-06-22)
------------------
- Fix regression when passing swagger parameters of type header in ``_request_options`` introduced by PR #288

9.0.3 (2017-06-21)
------------------
- When using the fido HTTP client and passing a timeout to ``result()``, make sure we throw a fido HTTPTimeoutError instead of a crochet TimeoutError when hitting the timeout.

9.0.2 (2017-06-12)
------------------
- ``_requests_options`` headers are casted to ``string`` to support newer version of ``requests`` library.

9.0.1 (2017-06-09)
------------------
- Convert http method to str while constructing the request to fix an issue with file uploads when using requests library versions before 2.8.

9.0.0 (2017-06-06)
------------------
- Add API key authentication via header to RequestsClient.
- Fido client is now an optional dependency. **NOTE**: if you intend to use bravado with the fido client you need to install bravado with fido extras (``pip install bravado[fido]``)

8.4.0 (2016-09-27)
------------------
- Remove support for Python 2.6, fixing a build failure.
- Switch from Python 3.4 to Python 3.5 for tests.

------------------
- Don't unnecessarily constrain the version of twisted when not using python 2.6

8.1.1 (2016-04-13)
------------------

8.1.0 (2016-04-04)
------------------
- Support for YAML Swagger specs - PR #198
- Remove pytest-mock dependency from requirements-dev.txt. No longer used and it was breaking the build.

8.0.0 (2015-11-25)
------------------
- Support for recursive $refs
- Support for remote $refs e.g. Swagger 2.0 specs that span multiple json files
- Requires bravado-core 4.0.0 which is not backwards compatible (See its `CHANGELOG <http://bravado-core.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html>`_)
- Transitively requires swagger-spec-validator 2.0.2 which is not backwards compatible (See its `CHANGELOG <http://swagger-spec-validator.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html>`_)

7.0.0 (2015-10-23)
------------------
- Support per-request response_callbacks_ to enable ``SwaggerClient``
  decorators to instrument an ``IncomingResponse`` post-receive. This is a
  non-backwards compatible change iff you have implemented a custom
  ``HttpClient``. Consult the changes in signature to ``HttpClient.request()``
  and ``HttpFuture``'s constructor.

  like headers and status code. See `Advanced Usage`_

.. _`Advanced Usage`: advanced.html#getting-access-to-the-http-response

6.0.0 (2015-10-12)
------------------
