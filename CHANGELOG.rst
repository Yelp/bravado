Changelog
=========

6.1.0 (2015-XX-XX)
------------------
- Clients can now access the HTTP response from a service call to access things
  like headers and status code. See `Advanced Usage <http://http://bravado.readthedocs.org/en/latest/advanced.html#getting-access-to-the-http-response>`_

6.0.0 (2015-10-12)
------------------
- User-defined formats are no longer global. The registration mechanism has
  changed and is now done via configuration. See `configuration <http://bravado.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html>`_.

5.0.0 (2015-08-27)
------------------
- Update ResourceDecorator to return an operation as a CallableOperation
  instead of a function wrapper (for the docstring). This allows further

- Consistent bravado.exception.HTTPError now thrown from both Fido and Requests http clients.

------------------
- Support passing in connect_timeout and timeout via _request_options to the Fido and Requests clients
